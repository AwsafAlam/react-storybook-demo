# react-storybook-demo
Demo of react storybook for UI component testing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# storybook

- Add storybook with `npm storybook` command or you can all it globally also
- This wil install all the necessary dependencies. I had some issues with npm install so I had to run `npm i   separately.
- Once that is done, a `.storybook` folder will be created with the config file
- `src/storybook` ill have all the react-js code for ui tsting. you have to import components separately to build out the entire storybook.
- finally run npm run storybook and it will start running on port 9090 😀 😎
